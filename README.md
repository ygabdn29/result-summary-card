## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I'm exercising what I've learned about combining flex and grid to create a layout. Also in this challenge I tried to create some rough sketches using pencil and paper to give me general ideas about the layout that I want to create. This process helped me to create a more clear markup, though in my opinion my markup still messy but I hope by continuuing this process will make my markup more organized in the future.

### Continued development

- Fetching data from local json and put the data into summary rather than hard code it.
- Spacing and color scheme used in my solution could be improved in the future.
